Description: JTAG flashing tool for FPGAs, CPLDs and EEPROMs
 xc3sprog is a suite of utilities for programming Xilinx FPGAs, CPLDs, and
 EEPROMs with the Xilinx Parallel Cable and other JTAG adapters under Linux.
 xc3sprog runs as a command-line application.
 .
 The main features include:
  - Reading a .BIT file from Xilinx design tools and programming it into an
    FPGA.
  - Reading a JEDEC file and programming it into a CPLD.
  - Programming a .BIT file into an on-board configuration PROM.
  - Programming a binary image into on-board SPI flash memory.
  - Reading the contents of a PROM chip back to a file.
  - Programming AVR microcontrollers.
 .
 The functionality of xc3sprog is similar to that of Xilinx IMPACT. There are
 also similarities with other free JTAG tools, such as UrJTAG. However,
 xc3sprog has a number of advantages:
 .
  - xc3sprog is free software.
  - It is a command-line tool.
  - It works on Linux without the need to install binary "cable-drivers".
    (Although some types of JTAG cables need to load firmware.)
  - It uses an optional configuration file to recognize new JTAG devices.
  - It contains programming algorithms for the supported devices, enabling
    the direct use of binary files (.BIT / JEDEC) from design tools (as opposed
    to intermediate SVF/STAPLE files).
